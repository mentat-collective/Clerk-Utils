{{description}}

This project is powered by Clerk. Your first notebook lives at
`notebooks/{{top/file}}/{{main/file}}.clj`.

## Dependencies

- [Clojure CLI tools](https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure)
- [`babashka`](https://github.com/babashka/babashka#installation)

You'll also need `node` installed, preferably via
[`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

TODO we use Babashka. To see all tasks, run

```sh
bb tasks
```

## Developing with Clerk



To start a server for local Clerk development, run

```sh
bb clerk-watch
```

This will start the Clerk server at http://localhost:{{port}} with a file
watcher that updates the page each time any file in the `src` directory changes.

### REPL-Based Development

This is the next level!

To manually start the Clerk webserver, start a REPL by running

```sh
clj
```

Then start the server:

```clj
(serve!)
```

To show a file, pass it to `clerk/show!`:

```clj
(clerk/show! "notebooks/{{top/file}}/{{main/file}}.clj")
```

> **Note**
> These commands work because dev/user.clj requires `nextjournal.clerk` under a
> `clerk` alias, and defines a `serve!` function.

## Static Builds

To generate the site to `public/build`:

```sh
bb build-static
```

View it with

```
bb serve
```

Or do both together with

```
bb publish-local
```

### Local Build

Run

```
bb build-static
```

To generate a static site locally.

### Push to GitHub

Create a repo at https://github.com/new.

### Garden

The easiest way to share a static build is to push to GitHub, then visit

https://github.clerk.garden/{{raw-name}}


### GitHub Pages

To release to GitHub Pages, run

```
bb release-gh-pages
```

#### Custom Domain

TODO describe custom name... [follow these
instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site),
then pass the `:cname` key in `user.clj`.

## Linting

Run

```
clj-kondo --copy-configs --dependencies --lint "$(clojure -A:nextjournal/clerk -Spath)"
```

Then

```
bb lint
```
